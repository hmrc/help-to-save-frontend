/**
 * This is an `Actor` which handles changing of state when a lock is acquired or a lock
 * is released. On start-up the `Lock` will try to acquire a lock using the given `LockProvider`.
 * If successful `onLockAcquired` is called on the `initialState`. Otherwise `onLockReleased` is
 * called on the `initialState`. The state is updated at this point.  When the lock duration defined
 * in the `LockProvider` has passed this `Actor` will try to acquire/renew a lock again. If successful
 * `onLockAcquired` is called on the current state. Otherwise `onLockReleased` is called on the
 * current state. This continues until the `Actor` dies.
 *
 * The actor will register a release of the lock using the `registerStopHook` function. For Play applications
 * the appropriate function is the `addStopHook` from the injectable `ApplicationLifecycle`. If this release
 * is successful `onLockReleased` is called.
 *
 * N.B.: If the process of trying to acquire/renew a lock fails for any reason the state is not changed.
